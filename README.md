# code-challenge

I wasn't able to finish, but I think if I had another hour or so I probably could have. I ended up having a lot of issues connecting the server to the application.
I have been mostly working in ReactJS with internal company generators so I have gotten a bit rusty on setting up some of the more nuanced environment details as well as data storage and whatnot in VueJS.

While I didn't finish, you will see that I did get the API call working although for now I am simply console logging the results.

To do this, navigate first to the server (webservice) and run `npm install` and then `node index.js`

Then, in a separate terminal, navigate to the application (webapp/code-challenge) and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`

  NOTE: You might need to run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` before the application will run.

In the future, I would definitely spend more time refamiliarizing myself with Vue prior to beginning this. I would have loved to have spent more time styling the app and adding details like modals for more detailed information.
